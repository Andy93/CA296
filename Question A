//Write a program to multiply a number by 2 serveral times (you decide) using a SHL
//instruction. At What point does the multiplication no longer happen correctly?

Start of code :


  MOV AL,5; the number that will be multiplied
  MOV BL,3; the amount of times the loop will be run i.e. multiply times
  
LOOP:
  SHL AL; multiplying AL once
  DEC BL; decrementing BL
  JNZ LOOP; loop jump
  
END;


//When BL reaches 0 the loop will end i.e. making the multiplication no longer 
//happen correctly
