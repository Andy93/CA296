//Write a program to split the digits in AL into BL and CL. E.g. if AL contains E9
//then BL should contain a 0E and CL should contain a 09

//Start of Code:

  MOV AL, E9;
  
  PUSH AL; push to stack and make backup
  AND AL, OF;
  MOV CL, AL; copy the value to CL
  
  POP AL; restore AL back to original value
  AND AL, F0;
  MOV BL,AL ; copy the value to BL
  DIV BL, 10
  
END
